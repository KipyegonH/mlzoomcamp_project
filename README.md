# Credit Card Default Prediction

This project aims to predict the likelihood of a client defaulting on their credit card payment next month using machine learning models. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training.

## Problem Definition

Credit card defaulting is a major risk for financial institutions. When clients fail to meet their payment obligations, it affects the profitability and sustainability of credit systems. Financial institutions require predictive systems to identify high-risk clients in advance, enabling them to make informed decisions such as adjusting credit limits, changing repayment plans, or taking preemptive actions.

This project addresses the problem of predicting credit card defaults by leveraging a dataset of 30,000 clients, containing their demographic information, credit history, and repayment patterns. The key objective is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts whether a client will default on their credit card payment in the following month.

### Business Significance
Accurate predictions can:
1. Reduce financial losses by proactively managing high-risk clients.
2. Optimize credit allocation and customer risk profiling.
3. Support strategic decision-making by providing actionable insights into repayment behaviors.

## Project Overview
Credit card defaults pose a significant risk to financial institutions. This project uses a dataset of credit card clients to build a predictive model for identifying potential defaults. The goal is to help financial institutions mitigate risk and make data-driven decisions.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains information on 30,000 credit card clients in Taiwan from April to September 2005. It includes demographic details, billing information, and repayment status. The target variable is `default_payment`, indicating if a client will default next month.

### Key Features
- **Demographics**: Gender, age, education level, and marital status.
- **Credit and Billing**: Credit limit, past payments, and bill amounts.
- **Target**: Whether the client defaulted (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KipyegonH/mlzoomcamp_project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd 'ML PROJECT'
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the project in Docker (optional):
   ```bash
   docker build -t credit-card-default .
   docker run -p 9696:9696 credit-card-default
   ```

## Usage
- **Train the model**:
  ```bash
  python train.py
  ```
- **Serve predictions**:
  ```bash
  python predict.py
  ```
- Access the web service at `http://localhost:9696`.

## Deployment
This project can be deployed locally using Docker or to the cloud using AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Below are the detailed steps for both methods:

### Deploy Locally with Docker

#### Step 1: Install Docker
Ensure Docker is installed on your system. If not, refer to the [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

#### Step 2: Build the Docker Image
Run the following command to create a Docker image for the project:
```bash
docker build -t credit-card-default .
```

#### Step 3: Run the Docker Container
Start the Docker container and expose it on port `9696`:
```bash
docker run -p 9696:9696 credit-card-default
```

#### Step 4: Access the Service
The service will be available at [http://localhost:9696](http://localhost:9696).

### Deploy to AWS Elastic Beanstalk

#### Step 1: Install AWS Elastic Beanstalk CLI
Install the Elastic Beanstalk CLI by following the [AWS EB CLI installation guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3-install.html).

#### Step 2: Initialize Elastic Beanstalk
In the project directory, run:
```bash
eb init
```
- Choose your AWS region.
- Enter an application name (e.g., `credit-card-default`).
- Select `Docker` as the platform.
- Set up SSH access if required for troubleshooting.

#### Step 3: Create an Elastic Beanstalk Environment
Create a new environment to host the application:
```bash
eb create credit-card-default-env
```

#### Step 4: Deploy the Application
Use the following command to deploy the project to Elastic Beanstalk:
```bash
eb deploy
```

#### Step 5: Access the Application
Once deployed, Elastic Beanstalk will provide a URL to access your application. You can also use:
```bash
eb open
```

#### Step 6: Monitor and Manage
- To view logs:
  ```bash
  eb logs
  ```
- To terminate the environment when no longer needed:
  ```bash
  eb terminate credit-card-default-env
  ```
